CVE-2023-1281
affects: Linux kernel >= 4.14 && < git commit:ee059170b1f7e94e55fa6cadee544e176a6e59c2
description:Use After Free vulnerability in Linux kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) allows Privilege Escalation. The imperfect hash area can be updated while packets are traversing, which will cause a use-after-free when 'tcf_exts_exec()' is called with the destroyed tcf_ext. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.
