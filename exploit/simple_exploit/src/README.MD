How this works:
Binary, which is run as root, changes passwd file, removes the x between the two colons and logs in as root. Now the payload can go ahead

1.	check if program has been run as root : run ? exit
2.	look for /etc/passwd, scan each line, find root:x:, or similar
3.	cp passwd to original_passwd
4.	remove x
5.	write to file and allow payload to do its work
6.	once payload exits, mv original_passwd passwd
7.	exit
